# Project Title

A prototype 2D multiplayer sandbox game with procedurally generated terrain.
The project does work, but since it is a prototype it has many bugs and
unfinished features.

## Getting Started

The project can be imported into eclipse and built using gradle.

Alternatively you can try gradle cli, although this option never worked for me.

### Prerequisites

Gradle and java 8.
